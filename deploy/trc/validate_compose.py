Additive and TRC-only: no upstream tooling reads this file.

The load-bearing assertion is `external: true` on every network and volume.
Compose prefixes a non-external named volume with the project name, so
declaring `trc-staging-open-webui-data` without `external: true` silently
creates an empty `trc-staging-open-webui_trc-staging-open-webui-data` and uses
that instead of the real volume -- Open WebUI then boots with no chats, no
users and no settings, and does not error. Nothing in `compose up` output
reveals it, which is why it is asserted here rather than left to code review.

    # remaining third was dropped on purpose, to keep this deploy 1:1 with
    # trc-hermes-agent's, which has no cleanup step at all.
    #
    # What that costs, so it is on the record: the key FILE is fine, since it
    # lives only under $RUNNER_TEMP and the runner clears that at the start of
    # each job. The per-job ssh-agent is not -- nothing kills it, so it keeps
    # the DECRYPTED private key in memory on this persistent runner, reachable
    # by anything that can read its socket path, until the machine reboots, with
    # one more agent per dispatch. `pkill ssh-agent` on the runner reaps them.
    # The `~/.ssh/id_rsa` ban above is what still keeps sibling repos' deploys
    # from colliding over the key, and it is unaffected by any of this.
