"""Contract checks for the TRC staging deploy assets in this directory.

Additive and TRC-only: no upstream tooling reads this file.

The load-bearing assertion is `external: true` on every network and volume.
Compose prefixes a non-external named volume with the project name, so
declaring `trc-staging-open-webui-data` without `external: true` silently
creates an empty `trc-staging-open-webui_trc-staging-open-webui-data` and uses
that instead of the real volume -- Open WebUI then boots with no chats, no
users and no settings, and does not error. Nothing in `compose up` output
reveals it, which is why it is asserted here rather than left to code review.
